    # Odin Recipes

A simple project built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum to practice basic HTML structure and web development fundamentals.

## Project Description

This website is a collection of recipes, each displayed on its own page and linked from a main index page. The goal of the project is to practice:

- Creating multiple HTML pages
- Using relative links for navigation
- Structuring content with semantic HTML tags
- Building a simple, static website

## Features

- Home page linking to individual recipes
- Multiple recipe pages with ingredients and preparation steps
- Clean, simple HTML structure

## Tech Stack

- HTML5

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jrishere/odin-recipes.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website.

## Future Improvements

- Add CSS for styling and improved layout
- Incorporate images for each recipe
- Improve accessibility and mobile responsiveness
